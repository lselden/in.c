# in.c

in.c is a web application that uses the Web Audio API to perform Terry Riley's 1964 composition [In C][inc], accompanied by visualizations of the music being played.

The previous iteration of in.c [was developed for](http://cargocollective.com/user-required/Jeff-Pierce-and-Dave-Howell) the [User Required exhibition](http://cargocollective.com/user-required) at the Burlington City Arts gallery in Burlington, VT.

This iteration is their front-end code with the node + arduino bits taken out, so it’s suitable for web browser-only use
